# cdnpack
Simple package manager for the web, based on cdnjs API.

_Closed-source for now. This will only contain the compiled binaries on the releases._

### How to use it?
Simply running `cdnpack` _(`cdnpack.exe` on Windows, if the program isn't in your PATH)_.

### How to install it?
#### macOS and Linux
**1.** Grab the executable binary from the releases page.

**2.** With root privileges, move the binary to the `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` folder.

**3.** Profit.


#### Windows
**1.** Download the executable from the releases page to your user folder _(`C:\Windows\Users\<your name>/`)_.

**2.** Open your CMD and type in `SET "PATH=C:\Windows\Users\<your name>\cdnpack.exe;%PATH%"` to add the program to your path.

**3.** Profit.

_**Tip:** You can replace the `<your name>` fields with `%user%`._

_**Disclaimer:** I am not responsible of any problems caused to your computer by mistyping the commands above._

### When will it open source?
I don't know, to be honest. I'm kinda shy about my code.
